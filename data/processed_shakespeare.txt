 @ the merry cuckoo messenger of spring @ his trumpet shrill hath thrice already sounded @ that warns all lovers wait upon their king @ who now is coming forth with garland crowned @ with noise whereof the choir of birds resounded @ their anthems sweet devised of loves praise @ that all the woods their echoes back rebounded @ as if they knew the meaning of their lays @ but mongst them all which did loves honor raise @ no word was heard of her that most it ought @ but she his precept proudly disobeys @ and doth his idle message set at nought @ therefore o love unless she turn to thee @ ere cuckoo end let her a rebel be @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ in vain i seek and sue to her for grace @ and do mine humbled heart before her pour @ the whiles her foot she in my neck doth place @ and tread my life down in the lowly floor @ and yet the lion that is lord of power @ and reighneth over every beast in field @ in his most pride disdaineth to devour @ the silly lamb that to his might doth yield @ but she more cruel and more savage wild @ then either lion or lioness @ shames not to be with guiltless blood defiled @ but taketh glory in her cruelness @ fairer than fairest let none ever say @ that ye were blooded in a yielded prey @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ was it the work of nature or of art @ which tempered so the feature of her face @ that pride and meekness mixed by equal part @ do both appear tadorn her beautys grace @ for with mild pleasance which doth pride displace @ she to her love doth lookers eyes allure @ and with stern countenance back again doth chase @ their looser looks that stir up lusts impure @ with such strange terms her eyes she doth inure @ that with one look she doth my life dismay @ and with another doth it straight recure @ her smile me draws her frown me drives away @ thus doth she train and teach me with her looks @ such art of eyes i never read in books @

 @ 
 @ this holy season fit to fast and pray @ men to devotion ought to be inclined @ therefore i likewise on so holy day @ for my sweet saint some service fit will find @ her temple fair is built within my mind @ in which her glorious image placed is @ on which my thoughts do day and night attend @ like sacred priests that never think amiss @ there i to her as thauthor of my bliss @ will build an altar to appease her ire @ and on the same my heart will sacrifice @ burning in flames of pure and chaste desire @ the which vouchsafe o godess to accept @ amongst thy dearest relics to be kept @

 @ 
 @ penelope for her ulysses sake @ devised a web her wooers to deceive @ in which the work that she all day did make @ the same at night she did again unreave @ such subtle craft my damsel doth conceive @ thimportune suit of my desire to shun @ for all that i in many days do weave @ in one short hour i find by her undone @ so when i think to end that i begun @ i must begin and never bring to end @ for with one look she spills that long i spun @ and with one word my whole years work doth rend @ such labour like the spiders web i find @ whose fruitless work is broken with least wind @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ when i behold that beautys wonderment @ and rare perfection of each goodly part @ of natures skill the only complement @ i honor and admire the makers art @ but when i feel the bitter baleful smart @ which her fair eyes unwares do work in me @ that death out of their shiny beams do dart @ i think that i a new pandora see @ whom all the gods in council did agree @ into this sinful world from heaven to send @ that she to wicked men a scourge should be @ for all their faults with which they did offend @ but since ye are my scourge i will intreat @ that for my faults ye will me gently beat @

 @ 
 @ how long shall this like dying life endure @ and know no end of her own mystery @ but waste and wear away in terms unsure @ twixt fear and hope depending doubtfully @ yet better were at once to let me die @ and show the last ensample of your pride @ than to torment me thus with cruelty @ to prove your power which i too well have tried @ but yet if in your hardened breast ye hide @ a close intent at last to show me grace @ then all the woes and wrecks which i abide @ as means of bliss i gladly will embrace @ and wish that more and greater they might be @ that greater meede at last may turn to me @

 @ 
 @ coming to kiss her lips such grace i found @ me seemed i smelled a garden of sweet flowers @ that dainty odors from them threw around @ for damsels fit to deck their lovers bowers @ her lips did smell like unto gillyflowers @ her ruddy cheeks like unto roses red @ her snowy brows like budded bellamores @ her lovely eyes like pinks but newly spread @ her goodly bosom like a strawberry bed @ her neck like to a bunch of columbines @ her breast like lillies ere their leaves be shed @ her nipples like young blossomed jasmines @ such fragrant flowers do give most odorous smell @ but her sweet odor did them all excel @

 @ 
 @ the doubt which you misdeem fair love is vain @ that fondly fear to lose your liberty @ when losing one two liberties you gain @ and make him bond that bondage erst did fly @ sweet be the bands the which true love doth tie @ without constraint or dread of any ill @ the gentle bird feels no captivity @ within her cage but sings and feeds her fill @ there pride dare not approach nor discord spill @ the league twixt them that loyal love hath bound @ but simple truth and mutual good will @ seeks with sweet peace to salve each others wound @ there faith doth fearless dwell in brazen tower @ and spotless pleasure builds her sacred bower @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ to all those happy blissing which ye have @ with plenteous hand by heaven upon you thrown @ this one disparagement they to you gave @ that ye your love lent to so mean a one @ yet whose high worths surpassing paragon @ could not on earth have found one fit for mate @ ne but in heaven matchable to none @ why did ye stoop unto so lowly state @ but ye thereby much greater glory gate @ than had ye sorted with a princes peer @ for now your light doth more itself dilate @ and in my darkness greater doth appear @ yet since your light hath once enlumined me @ with my reflex yours shall increased be @

 @ one day i wrote her name upon the strand @ but came the waves and washed it away @ again i wrote it with a second hand @ but came the tide and made my pains his prey @ vain man said she that doest in vain assay @ a mortal thing so to immortalize @ for i myself shall like to this decay @ and eek my name be wiped out likewise @ no so quod i let baser things devise @ to die in dust but you shall live by fame @ my verse your virtues rare shall eternize @ and in the heavens write your glorious name @ where whenas death shall all the world subdue @ out love shall live and later life renew @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ fair bosom fraught with virtues riches treasure @ the nest of love the lodging of delight @ the bower of bliss the paradise of pleasure @ the sacred harbour of that heavenly sprite @ how was i ravished with your lovely sight @ and my frail thoughts too rashly led astray @ whiles diving deep through amorous insight @ on the sweet spoil of beauty they did prey @ and twixt her paps like early fruit in may @ whose harvest seemed to hasten now apace @ they loosly did their wanton wings display @ and there to rest themselves did boldly place @ sweet thoughts i envy your so happy rest @ which oft i wished yet never was so blest @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ was it a dream or did i see it plain @ a goodly table of pure ivory @ all spread with juncats fit to entertain @ the greatest prince with pompous royalty @ mongst which there in a silver dish did lie @ two golden apples of unvalued price @ far passing those which hercules came by @ or those which atalanta did entice @ exceeding sweet yet void of sinful vice @ that many sought yet none could ever taste @ sweet fruit of pleasure brought from paradise @ by love himself and in his garden placed @ her breast that table was so richly spread @ my thoughts the guests which would thereon have fed @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ lacking my love i go from place to place @ like a young fawn that late hath lost the hind @ and seek each where where last i saw her face @ whose image yet i carry fresh in mind @ i seek the fields with her late footing signed @ i seek her bower with her late presence decked @ yet nor in field nor bower i her can find @ yet field and bower are full of her aspect @ but when mine eyes i thereunto direct @ they idly back return to me again @ and when i hope to see their true object @ i find myself but fed with fancies vain @ cease then mine eyes to seek herself to see @ and let my thoughts behold herself in me @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ men call you fair and you do credit it @ for that yourself ye daily such do see @ but the true fair that is the gentle wit @ and virtuous mind is much more prayed of me @ for all the rest how ever fair it be @ shall turn to naught and loose that glorious hue @ but only that is permanent and free @ from frail corruption that doth flesh ensue @ that is true beauty that doth argue you @ to be divine and born of heavenly seed @ derivd from that fair spirit from whom all true @ and perfect beauty did at first proceed @ he only fair and what he fair hath made @ all other fair like flowers untimely fade @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ after so long a race as i have run @ through faery land which those six books compile @ give leave to rest me being half fordone @ and gather to myself new breath awhile @ then as a steed refreshed after toil @ out of my prison i will break anew @ and stoutly will that second work assoyle @ with strong endeavor and attention due @ till then give leave to me in pleasant mew @ to sport my muse and sing my loves sweet praise @ the contemplation of whose heavenly hue @ my spirit to an higher pitch will raise @ but let her praises yet be low and mean @ fit for the handmaid of the faery queene @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ fair is my love when her fair golden heares @ with the loose wind ye waving chance to mark @ fair when the rose in her red cheeks appears @ or in her eyes the fire of love does spark @ fair when her breast like a richladen bark @ with precious merchandise she forth doth lay @ fair when that cloud of pride which oft doth dark @ her goodly light with smiles she drives away @ but fairest she when so she doth display @ the gate with pearls and rubies richly dight @ through which her words so wise do make their way @ to bear the message of her gentle sprite @ the rest be works of natures wonderment @ but this the work of hearts astonishment @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ joy of my life full oft for loving you @ i bless my lot that was so lucky placed @ but then the more your own mishap i rue @ that are so much by so mean love debased @ for had the equal heavens so much you graced @ in this as in the rest ye mote invent @ soom heavenly wit whose verse could have enchased @ your glorious name in golden monument @ but since ye deigned so goodly to relent @ to me your thrall in whom is little worth @ that little that i am shall all be spent @ in setting your immoral praises forth @ whose lofty argument uplifting me @ shall lift you up unto an high degree @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ my hungry eyes through greedy covetize @ still to behold the object of their pain @ with no contentment can themselves suffice @ but having pine and having not complain @ for lacking it they cannot life sustain @ and seeing it they gaze on it the more @ in their amazement like narcissus vain @ whose eyes him starvd so plenty makes me poor @ yet are mine eyes so filled with the store @ of that fair sight that nothing else they brook @ but loath the things which they did like before @ and can no more endure on them to look @ all this worlds glory seemeth vain to me @ and all their shows but shadows saving she @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ let not one spark of filthy lustfull fire @ break out that may her sacred peace molest @ ne one light glance of sensual desire @ attempt to work her gentle minds unrest @ but pure affections bred in spotless breast @ and modest thoughts breathed from well tempered sprites @ go visit her in her chaste bower of rest @ accompanied with angelic delights @ there fill yourself with those most joyous sights @ the which myself could never yet attain @ but speak no word to her of these sad plights @ which her too constant stiffness doth constrain @ only behold her rare perfection @ and bless your fortunes fair election @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ the world that cannot deem of worthy things @ when i do praise her say i do but flatter @ so does the cuckoo when the mavis sings @ begin his witless note apace to clatter @ but they that skill not of so heavenly matter @ all that they know not envy or admire @ rather than envy let them wonder at her @ but not to deem of her desert aspire @ deep in the closet of my parts entire @ her worth is written with a golden quill @ that me with heavenly fury doth inspire @ and my glad mouth with her sweet praises fill @ which when as fame in her shrill trump shall thunder @ let the world choose to envy or to wonder @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ venemous tongue tipped with vile adders sting @ of that self kind with which the furies fell @ their snaky heads do comb from which a spring @ of poisoned words and spiteful speeches well @ let all the plagues and horrid pains of hell @ upon thee fall for thine accursed hire @ that with falseforged lies which thou didst tell @ in my true love did stir up coals of ire @ the sparks whereof let kindle thine own fire @ and catching hold on thine own wicked head @ consume thee quite that didst with guile conspire @ in my sweet peace such breaches to have bred @ shame be thy meed and mischief thy reward @ due to thyself that it for me prepared @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ since i did leave the presence of my love @ many long weary days have i outworn @ and many nights that slowly seemed to move @ their sad protract from evening until morn @ for when as day the heaven doth adorn @ i wish that night the noyous day would end @ and when as night hath us of light forlorn @ i wish that day would shortly reascend @ thus i the time with expectation spend @ and fain my grief with changes to beguile @ that further seems his term still to extend @ and maketh every minute seem a mile @ so sorrow still doth seem too long to last @ but joyous hours do fly away too fast @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ since i have lacked the comfort of that light @ the which was wont to lead my thoughts astray @ i wander as in darkness of the night @ afraid of every dangers least dismay @ ne ought i see though in the clearest day @ when others gaze upon their shadows vain @ but thonly image of that heavenly ray @ whereof some glance doth in mine eye remain @ of which beholding the idea plain @ through contemplation of my purest part @ with light thereof i do myself sustain @ and thereon feed my loveafamished heart @ but with such brightness whilst i fill my mind @ i starve my body and mine eyes do blind @ 
 @ 
 @ 
 @ like as the culver on the bared bough @ sits mourning for the absence of her mate @ and in her songs sends many a wishful vow @ for his return that seems to linger late @ so i alone now left disconsolate @ mourn to myself the absence of my love @ and wandering here and there all desolate @ seek with my plaints to match that mournful dove @ ne joy of aught that under heaven doth hove @ can comfort me but her own joyous sight @ whose sweet aspect both god and man can move @ in her unspotted pleasauns to delight @ dark is my day while her fair light i miss @ and dead my life that wants such lively bliss
